Today’s channel strategy session focuses on two items: 618 pricing rules and the pressure from East China.\nCEO Zhang: National sell-through in Q1 was +18% YoY, but East China only grew 5%. Price conflicts remain the main reason—some distributors dump flagship models online.\nGM Li: During last week’s store tour, promoters in lower-tier cities had no idea about the 618 policy, so we lost orders to competitors.\nSupplier A: Compressor supply is fine. What we need is an early purchase order. Please share the 618 forecast this week so we can prepare materials.\nMarketing: Let’s introduce a tiered rebate. If a distributor hits 120% of target, bump the rebate from 3% to 4.5% to motivate them.\nCEO Zhang: Got it. Send me the key account list tonight. The pricing framework must be locked this week."
